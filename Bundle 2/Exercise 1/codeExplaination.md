3. git push origin ft/bundle-2
- Purpose:
1. git add stages changes for commit.

3. git push uploads the branch to the remote repository.
- Skill Gained:
   Understanding version control and how to document changes effectively.
- Importance:
 Committing changes with meaningful messages helps in tracking project history and understanding the evolution of the codebase.
