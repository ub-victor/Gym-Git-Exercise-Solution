        <p>When created a new branch (ft/bundle-2) and made your initial commit, but when you tried to push your changes to the remote repository, you encountered an error. This means that the local branch does not have an upstream branch set up for pushing changes to.

            To resolve this, you can run the command suggested in the error message to set the upstream branch:
            
            bash
            git push --set-upstream origin ft/bundle-2  
            This command does two things:
            
            Pushes your local ft/bundle-2 branch to the remote origin.
            Sets the remote origin/ft/bundle-2 branch as the upstream branch for your local ft/bundle-2 branch.</p>
