    <h1>Stash exercices</h1>
    <p>Git stash is a valuable tool for managing uncommitted changes in Git. It allows users to temporarily hide changes without committing, enabling branch switching. Key commands include git stash to save changes and git stash pop to retrieve them. Users can also apply or manage multiple stashes effectively.
