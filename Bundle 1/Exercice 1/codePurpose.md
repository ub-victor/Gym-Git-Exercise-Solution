# Purpose of the Exercise
This exercise is designed to familiarize you with basic Git and GitHub operations, which are essential for version control and collaborative software development. Understanding these concepts is crucial because:

### Version Control:
 Git allows you to track changes in your code, making it easier to manage different versions of your project.
### Collaboration:
 GitHub provides a platform for multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, facilitating collaboration.

### Branching: 

Branches allow you to work on features or fixes in isolation without affecting the main codebase, which is vital for maintaining a stable project.
